# HelloCommanderController
## The Vision
Play StarCraft2 like a real commander, by yelling at your subordinates.
## Implementation
Use the SC2 api: https://blizzard.github.io/s2client-api/
## I know very little about voice recognition stuff but this seems doable.
## Roadmap
### Build an SCV
### Continously build SCV
### Build Supply depots
### Build Barracks
### Build Marines
### Rough Strategy
Attack and Defend
### Build every Terran Unit
### Special Tactics
Splitting army
Microing marines
Dropping enemy base
Expanding
Walling off
Focus firing
### Autopilot
Autopilot should be not very good though intentionally, otherwise this wouldn't be much fun to play. But first 1-2 minutes of the game basically are the same for most games so can be autopilot
