# HelloCommanderController
## The Vision
Play StarCraft2 like a real commander, by yelling at your subordinates.
## Implementation
Use the newer SC2 api: [https://blizzard.github.io/s2client-api/](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/cpp-sc2)
## Roadmap
### Build an SCV
### Continuously build SCV
Build and rally them to the mineral line  
Build and rally to gas  
Send to expansion when base is saturated  
### Build Supply depots
Continuously build these until max supply reached  
### Build Barracks
Build it next to the ramp  
allow room for add-ons  
### Build Marines
Build from 1 barracks  
from multiple barracks  
### Build every Terran Unit
### Rough Strategy
Attack and Defend  
Select all units  
Go to expansion  
Rally production to the fight  
Build Mech/Air/Ground.  
### Special Tactics
Splitting army  
Microing marines  
Dropping enemy base
Expanding  
Walling off  
Focus firing  
Mass liberator/tank advancing  
counter attacking  
proxy barracks, early harass  
Ghost control  
Battlecruisers 
### Autopilot
Autopilot should be not very good though intentionally, otherwise this wouldn't be much fun to play. But first 1-2 minutes of the game basically is the same for most games so can be autopilot  
Cap all actions at like 100 APM or Something.  
Maybe additional rules to autopilot, like if there's a Raven or a Battlecruiser nearby a set of units then they will be micro'd better.
